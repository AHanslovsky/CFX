            This structure contains information about a one of a set of production units that are processed simultaneously under a single transaction by an endpoint.
            Units may be identified in one of two ways:
                1.  The UnitIdentifier property represents the actual unique identifier of the production unit.
                2.  The UnitIdentifier property represents the unique identifier of the "carrier" or "PCB panel"
                    AND the PositionNumber property represents the position of the unit within the carrier/panel.
                    PositionNumber's are established as defined in the CFX Standard.
